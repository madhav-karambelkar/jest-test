Different Software development strategies

    - Data Driven Development 
        Focuses on using data to guide development decisions and processes, particularly in analytics-heavy applications.

    - Feature Driven Development
        Emphasizes iterative development of individual features, breaking down larger projects into manageable chunks.

    - Model Driven Development
        Involves creating models to represent different aspects of a software system, with code generation based on these models.

    - Design Driven Development
        Prioritizes design principles and user experience in the development process, emphasizing iterative design and prototyping.

    - Domain Driven Development
        Focuses on understanding and modeling the domain of the problem being solved, promoting collaboration between domain experts and developers.

    - Document Driven Development
        Involves creating comprehensive documentation as a central part of the development process, guiding developers and stakeholders.

    - User Driven Development
        Prioritizes user input and feedback throughout the development process, ensuring the software meets user needs and expectations.

    - Test Driven Development
        Involves writing tests before writing code, aiming to improve code quality, maintainability, and design.

    - Behaviour Driven Development
        Extends TDD by emphasizing the behavior of the system, with tests written in human-readable syntax to encourage collaboration between stakeholders.
