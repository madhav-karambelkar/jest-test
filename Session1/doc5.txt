TDD in a nutshell

Understanding the task with OICE ( output, input, constraint, and edge case)

- Test one unit of functionality
- Pass the test
- Refactor the code

As test become more specific our code become more generic

Task -> 

The specification is to write a function that takes an string an returns an object of the words and number of times they are used in that string

- Further specification
    - An empty string would return and empty object
    - An string must only use english words - punctuations and numbers are not allowed
    - Words must be lower case

Note: You can use this regex: `/[^ ]+/g` to split a string.

OICE 

Input : String
Output : object
Constraints : always a string
edge case : not now but later string and number would be edge case
